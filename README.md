# ROKKET_JUMP
 The game revolves around a robot, ROKKET, escaping from a flood by jumping from platform to platform. To jump, the player needs to spam their space key. The faster they spam, the higher ROKKET jump. This is my first Unity project and unfortunately, I lost the Unity build so there's only the executable.
